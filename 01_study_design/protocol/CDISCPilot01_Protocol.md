## 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### 2.1 Disease Background

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and loss of functional independence. It is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting millions of individuals worldwide.

### 2.2 Rationale for Xanomeline

Xanomeline is a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease suggests that the cognitive deficits associated with AD are due, in part, to a deficiency in acetylcholine. Xanomeline is being developed as a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) to provide continuous drug delivery while minimizing gastrointestinal side effects.

### 2.3 Rationale for the Study

This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of xanomeline TTS compared to placebo in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The transdermal delivery system is expected to provide stable plasma concentrations and improve tolerability.

---

## 8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 8.1 Sample Size Justification

Based on previous studies with cholinergic agents in Alzheimer's disease, a sample size of 100 subjects per treatment group (300 total) will provide approximately 80% power to detect a difference of 3 points in the ADAS-Cog change from baseline between active and placebo groups, assuming a standard deviation of 7 points and a two-sided alpha of 0.05.

### 8.2 Analysis Populations

| Population | Definition |
|------------|------------|
| Intent-to-Treat (ITT) | All randomized subjects |
| Safety | All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug |
| Per-Protocol | ITT subjects without major protocol violations |
| Efficacy | Subjects with baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment |

### 8.3 Primary Efficacy Analysis

The primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline to Week 24 in ADAS-Cog score) will be analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment as a factor and baseline ADAS-Cog score as a covariate. Pairwise comparisons between each xanomeline dose group and placebo will be performed. Missing data will be imputed using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.

### 8.4 Secondary Efficacy Analyses

- CIBIC+ will be analyzed using categorical methods
- NPI-X change from baseline will be analyzed using ANCOVA
- Safety data will be summarized descriptively

### 8.5 Interim Analysis

No formal interim analysis is planned. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data periodically.

## 12. APPENDICES

### Appendix A: ADAS-Cog Scale Description

The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) is an 11-item scale that measures cognitive function in areas including memory, language, orientation, and praxis. Total scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.

### Appendix B: CIBIC+ Scale Description

The Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change with Caregiver Input (CIBIC+) is a 7-point rating scale that assesses global clinical change:
- 1 = Very much improved
- 2 = Much improved
- 3 = Minimally improved
- 4 = No change
- 5 = Minimally worse
- 6 = Much worse
- 7 = Very much worse

### Appendix C: NPI-X Scale Description

The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) assesses behavioral disturbances in dementia across 12 domains. Each domain is scored for frequency and severity.
